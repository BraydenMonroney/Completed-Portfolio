                        <p>Im pretty much coding a lot now because I have nothing else to do. I have no friends and I feel empty inside. I look forward to work because theres nothing for me at home, but at work there is friends and girls and stuff, and its a very simple and relaxing job. I try to stay longer most days because I know that if I go home Im just going to sit around all day and rot and feel bad for myself and watch shit on my phone all the time. I have started working on code extensively and have kind of made some progress. I made a code that is good for data collection or for surveying. I can input values and it can somewhat sort what kind of data is being collected </p>
